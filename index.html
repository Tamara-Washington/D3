<h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
<p>Tobacco use remains to be the leading cause of preventable death around the world (1). It is associated with an increased risk of various diseases, including respiratory problems, cardiovascular disorders and cancers (2, 3). Being the key determinant of tobacco addiction, nicotine dependence (ND) is one of the major barriers of successful smoking cessation (4–6). The incidence of smoking cessation varies with age (7). The quitting ratio in young (21–31 years old) and old (51–60 years old) adults appears to be greater than that in middle aged (31–50 years old) group. Previous studies conducted in South Korea (8) and China (9) demonstrate that ND has an inverse U-shaped relationship with age, with the peak at 50 years of age. That supports and may partially account for what underlies the cessation-age trend found by Fidler et al. (7).
    However, the number of studies on the relationship between ND and age is very limited. Furthermore, almost all participants in previous researches live in cities. Many characteristics such as income, occupation, educational etc. are different between urban and rural dwellers (10–12). Therefore, that whether the above-mentioned cessation-age trend is suitable for the rural residents needs to be further explored.
    In this study, we used Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) to assess the degree of ND among rural male current smokers in China and investigated the relationship between ND and age, which will provide evidence needed to better-informed education for tobacco control intervention.(Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4441962/) </p>
